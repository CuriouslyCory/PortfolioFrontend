			Insight Enterprises Inc’s first mobile application. Built cross platform (Android and iOS) using AngularJS, 
			and Cordova, the application leverages an internal API that I built using Zend Framework 2. The customer 
			facing mobile application gives a customer access to trouble ticket information, updates, and push 
			notifications; along with access to managed device information, projects, notices, and more.

			Ultimate prospector is the mobile version of Responsive Data’s flagship CRM web application. Built with cordova, 
			HTML5, sass, and javascript, the ultimate prospector mirrors a lot of the features available in the web application 
			with the notable added benefit of being able to send text messages and receive real time notifications. Since the 
			business model requires a lot of rebranding and white labeling for clients the app was built in a way that it is 
			easy to theme, compile, and release to the app store, and helped manage releases of updates across the various 
			versions of the app on the markets.

			Exclusive Clicks is an affiliate network management utility. The process starts with an affiliate applying to join the 
			network, then through a management utility the application is approved or denied. Once approved an affiliate can log in 
			and browse the campaigns they have available, choose banners, or other creatives, and run the ad on their website. Impressions, 
			clicks, and conversions are then tracked, and once an affiliate reaches their payout minimum, a management utility will 
			print out reports for payouts. Other management utilities allow for adding or editing campaigns and creatives, changing 
			commission rates, and targeting/blocking bad traffic sources.
